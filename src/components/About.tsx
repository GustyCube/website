              <p>I&apos;m a passionate full-stack developer based in the United States, who discovered the magic of programming at just 5 years old. What started as childhood curiosity has evolved into a comprehensive expertise spanning multiple programming languages, frameworks, and cutting-edge technologies.</p>
              <p>My journey through technology has been driven by an insatiable curiosity about how things work, from the smallest algorithms to the largest distributed systems. I believe in building solutions that not only solve problems but also push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible.</p>

              <p>Beyond coding, I&apos;m deeply fascinated by all kinds of sciences — from computer science and mathematics to physics, biology, and cognitive science. I&apos;m equally passionate about philosophy and ethics, exploring how technology intersects with human values and societal progress.</p>
              <p>I believe in the power of democratic values and ethical approaches to technology development. My diverse interests fuel my approach to problem-solving, bringing interdisciplinary thinking to every project I tackle.</p>
